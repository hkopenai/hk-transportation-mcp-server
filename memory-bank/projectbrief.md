# Project Brief

## Overview
This project, hosted at `hkopenai/hk-transportation-mcp-server`, focuses on developing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Hong Kong transportation data. The server provides tools and resources to access and analyze transportation-related information.

## Core Requirements
- Develop and maintain an MCP server to interface with Hong Kong transportation data.
- Implement tools for fetching passenger statistics, bus route information, and land boundary wait times.
- Ensure the server is compatible with the MCP framework for seamless integration with other systems.

## Goals
- Provide accurate and up-to-date transportation data for users and applications.
- Enhance accessibility to transportation information through well-documented APIs and tools.
- Maintain a modular and scalable architecture for future expansions or modifications.

## Scope
The scope includes the development of Python-based tools and tests for the MCP server, focusing on data retrieval and processing specific to Hong Kong's transportation systems. This includes integration with external data sources and ensuring data integrity and availability.
