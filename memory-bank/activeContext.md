# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on expanding test coverage for the Hong Kong Transportation MCP Server project. This involves developing comprehensive tests to ensure the robustness of all tools and server components, building on the established Memory Bank structure for documentation and continuity.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to outline the project's core requirements and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` to detail the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals of the project.
- Initiated setup of the Memory Bank directory and core files for persistent project documentation.

## Next Steps
- Develop and expand test coverage for all tools and server components to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Review and refine the content of all core Memory Bank files to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Document specific technical patterns and decisions related to the MCP server implementation, with a focus on testing strategies.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Determining the optimal structure for additional context files or folders within the Memory Bank for future feature documentation or integration specifications.
- Considering how to best integrate user feedback mechanisms into the documentation process for continuous improvement.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Maintain all documentation in Markdown format for ease of readability and version control.
- Ensure hierarchical organization of information, with `projectbrief.md` as the foundational document guiding other files.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The importance of a well-structured Memory Bank for maintaining project continuity, especially given memory resets between sessions.
- Initial insights into the project's scope suggest a need for clear delineation between user-facing data tools and backend data processing logic.
