# Progress

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Structure**: The foundational documentation structure has been established with the creation of core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
- **Project Overview**: A clear understanding of the project's purpose and scope has been documented, focusing on the Hong Kong Transportation MCP Server.
- **Initial Documentation**: Basic content for system architecture, technical context, and user experience goals is in place to guide future development.
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Updated test files for passenger traffic, bus routes (KMB), and land boundary wait times with additional test cases for error handling, edge cases, and language variations to ensure robustness and reliability.

## What's Left to Build
- **Tool Enhancements**: Further development of specific tools for additional transportation data types or improved data processing capabilities.
- **Documentation Refinement**: Continuous updates to Memory Bank files as the project evolves, including additional context files for complex features or integrations.
- **Further Testing**: Additional performance and stress testing to handle large datasets and high request volumes for all tools.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Mechanisms to collect and incorporate user feedback into the development and documentation process.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Test Coverage Expansion
- **Focus**: Enhancing test coverage for all tools to ensure robustness and reliability, alongside maintaining the Memory Bank documentation.
- **Milestones Achieved**: Creation of all core Memory Bank files and significant updates to test coverage for passenger traffic, bus routes, and land boundary wait times.

## Known Issues
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Some areas, particularly detailed tool usage or advanced integration scenarios, require further elaboration in additional context files.
- **Data Source Variability**: Potential challenges with external data sources that may affect tool reliability, to be monitored and addressed as needed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Setup (Current)**: Decision to prioritize comprehensive documentation through the Memory Bank to ensure continuity across sessions, especially given memory resets.
- **Future Considerations**: Plans to adopt more dynamic documentation updates triggered by significant changes or user requests to keep the Memory Bank current and relevant.
